    <titleShort>Privateer</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>Wealth and status, the two things that matter most to a slug and by becoming a privateer you can ascertain both. On shore leave NAME could brag to all the honeys about all the perilous battles he’s been on protecting the borders of the slug worlds. When on the job HE could take HIS part of the loot from the poor little refugee ship that the slugs needed “protection” from. </baseDescription>

    <titleShort>Helper</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>Taking apart machines and putting them back together can be a real pain in the neck, more so if the machine only has a loose screw. That's why NAME put his telekinetic mind powers to use starting a business in an engi mechanical centre. NAME felt needed and valuable fixing tiny little issues in a blink of an eye for HIS engi friends, especially when they gave HIM the nickname TimeSaver NAME.</baseDescription>

    <title>Circus performer</title>
    <titleShort>performer</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>NAME ship crashed landed onto a primitive world where HE was taken in by a travelling circus. Suddenly the star performer in a freak show NAME didn’t really know what to make of his life. However, feeling the happiness that emanate from the crowd was like a drug to NAME, and HE soon became addicted. So despite the terrible food, hygiene and disease NAME didn’t think it was all that bad. Apart from the wild animal performances though, those scared HIM.
