    <baseDescription>NAME has always been curious. A fact nurtured by HIS parents, who filled HIS young brain with texts of economics, history and politics. What was left was a BOY that always questioned why people do the things they do. Except every time HE asked a person's intentions HE was left with vague answers or lies. Growing tired of this NAME choose to skip a step and learned to see directly into people mind. But whenever NAME looked into someone's mind, prying into their very soul, HE fell in love. To NAME consciousness is the most beautiful thing in the universe.

    <baseDescription>Most psychic skills are learned over time but for NAME it came from one event. HE was following HIS crush, someone HE always thought just got HIM. They were walking through HIS parents construction site and HE was building up the courage to ask HIS crush out but then disaster struck. A large stone fell from the scaffolding and rocketed its way down to the ground, right onto of HIS crush. In a fit of panic NAME yelled out stop, and the stone obeyed.

    <titleShort>Perceiver</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>NAME never knew his parents, HE was left abandoned in the pits of scum and villainy known as the Cave Streets. Quickly taken in by a gang NAME learned hard and fast how to recognise a friend from a foe, the blues of a cop, the greens of our rivals and the reds of your friends. The threat of random violence at anytime led to advances in NAMES senses. This manifested when a sniper from over 200 metres away shot at NAME and NAME ducked, just in time. It was after this his gang issued HIM a gun and HE never missed a shot.

    <baseDescription>NAME's life was filled with misfortune. One trip through the Cave Streets saw HIS parents dead and HIM moving into a orphanage. Except this was no ordinary orphanage, it was an underground cassino and HE was their newest waiter. NAME just took this in HIS stride, he was comfortable here, he could witness other people's misfortune and feel like HE was not the only one. HE got really used to that feeling, misfortune, so much so he could see it coming. HE started giving people tips on what to bet on and the casino lost so much money they decided to kicked HIM out. HE was alright though, the world's a whole lot better when you know what not to do. </baseDescription>
